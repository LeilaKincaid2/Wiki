<h3>Boats in Rust</h3>
<p>Now that we have boats in Rust, here is how they work</p>
<p>There are 3 main types of boats in Rust<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Rowboat</b>: small wooden boat that is usually found on beaches and uses Low Grad Fuel to run</li>
    <li><b>RHIB</b>: larger metal boat that is usually found in Offshore locations and also uses Low Grade Fuel, holds more people, is much faster and is more stable when going over waves.</li>
    <li><b>Cargoship</b>: large floating monument that was Scientists, Chinook, Heavy Scientists and lots of Loot</li>
   </ul>

      <h3>FACTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Have limited Hit Points when you encounter them on the beach</li>
        <li>Need to be repaired ( using Woood & Metal Frags ) while inside a Boathouse with walls and ceiling ( Doors are not necessary i believe )</li>
        <li>When they are destroyed (0hp) you can no longer push/mount them, their model just sits there.</li>
         <li>Needs to be pushed (using 'E' key) into nearby water before you make it move</li>
        <li>Can be tipped over by player/waves</li>
        <li>Can be flipped upright be hopping on top and pressing 'E' key to attempt flipping of said boat (takes a bit of practice)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TIPS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The easiest way to get LGF for your boat is to head to the lighthouse or nearby road and smash an Oil Barrel.  From there head to the ocean and gather further Oil Barrels.</li>
      </ul>
