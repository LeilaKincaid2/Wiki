      <h3>FACTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Have limited Hit Points when you encounter them on the beach</li>
        <li>Need to be repaired ( using Woood & Metal Frags ) while inside a Boathouse with walls and ceiling ( Doors are not necessary i believe )</li>
        <li>When they are destroyed (0hp) you can no longer push/mount them, their model just sits there.
      </ul>
      <h3>TIPS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The easiest way to get LGF for your boat is to head to the lighthouse or nearby road and smash an Oil Barrel.  From there head to the ocean and gather further Oil Barrels.</li>
      </ul>
