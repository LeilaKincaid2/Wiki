<td><p>A spawnpoint is a random location on the map where a "new" character will "spawn" into the game.  This area is governed by the Tier0 topology when painted via the editor.</p>
<h3>FACTS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spawnpoints cannot happen in the Arctic Biome or on Snow</li>
  <li>If Topologies are not properly painted you will spawn ( in most cases ) in the ocean and drown if you don't swim.</li>
  <li>Ohter nakeds can be found on beach near you.  Killing them and harvesting them will give you bone/fat/food.</li>
  <li>Animals such as Boar, Bear, Dear and Wolves can be found roaming the beaches/fields near spawn</li>
  <li>It is rarely "wise" to build at "spawn" for many reasons. Always run inland and gather hemp and place a bag.</li>
</ul>
